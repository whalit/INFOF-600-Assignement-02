    "\n",
    "This assignment contains a number of question that are worth 1--2 points each, as seen at the table below. At each question, you need to fill in the missing code, which is denoted by `...`. In some cases, you could write a single line of code, in other cases you might want to use more lines to achieve the desired outcome. **NOTE** that you should not change any code segment except the part denoted as `...`, as it might interfere with the auto grading, see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment will be automatically graded by running tests on the provided code. Some of the tests are available after each cell with missing code. To run the automatic grader, you need to have otter-grader installed. This is not mandatory, but advised, so that you can check the validity of your answers. **NOTE** that for the final grading we will run additional tests not available in this notebook.\n",

    "We understand that it is helpful to have extra cells breaking down the process towards reaching your final answer. If you happen to create new cells below your answer to run codes, **NEVER** add cells between a question cell and the answer cell below it. It will cause errors when we run the autograder, and it will sometimes cause a failure to generate the PDF file.\n",
